*  // A BEGINNING PROGRAMMER'S NOTE ABOUT STAGE CURTAINS AND STATE MACHINES //
*
*    COMPUTERS ARE SOPHISTICATED "STATE MACHINES".  WHAT'S A STATE
*    MACHINE?  WELL, IT'S A DEVICE THAT WORKS BY KEEPING TRACK OF
*    THINGS BEING IN ONE STATE OR ANOTHER.  CHARLES BABBAGE AND ADA BYRON
*    INVENTED THE FIRST COMPUTER, CALLED THE "DIFFERENCE ENGINE"; THEY
*    DIDN'T ACTUALLY BUILD ONE BUT IT WAS MEANT TO BE MADE OUT OF THOUSANDS
*    OF BRASS GEARS-- AND IT DIDN'T USE ANY ELECTRICITY!  TO MAKE THE CURTAINS
*    WORK, WE BUILT OUR OWN TINY STATE MACHINE, USING DRAGONSPEAK AND
*    ITS ABILITY TO INTERACT WITH THE MAP.*
*
*    THIS BIT OF DRAGONSPEAK IS FOR ACTORS ON THE THEATRE MEOVANNI
*    STAGE.  THE DARK WOOD SQUARES ARE THE SPACES THAT CAN BE SEEN FROM
*    ALL THE SEATS.  WHEN ANYBODY STANDING ON ONE OF THESE SIX SPACES
*    TYPES CONTROL-U WITH EMPTY HANDS, THEY OPERATE THE CURTAINS.
*    IF THERE ARE CURTAINS, THEY WILL GO AWAY; IF THE CURTAINS ARE GONE,
*    THEY WILL APPEAR.  ONE "INPUT" GIVES TWO DIFFERENT "OUTPUTS" DEPENDING
*    ON THE WAY THE CURTAINS WERE BEFORE.*
*
*    THE TILE BEHIND STAGE IS BEING USED AS A "VARIABLE".  AS YOU WORK THE
*    CURTAINS YOU CAN SEE IT CHANGE.  THIS IS OUR STATE MACHINE'S
*    "MEMORY".  IT HAS 3 STATES, `BLACK', `DOT', AND `WHITE'.
*    EACH TIME CONTROL-U IS PRESSED, THE GAME GOES THROUGH THE
*    DRAGONSPEAK SCRIPT, TRYING TO EXECUTE ALL THE COMMANDS IN ORDER.
*    THIS IS A "LINEAR" LANGUAGE, THAT IS, THE COMMANDS ARE LINED UP.
*    THE DOT STATE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT KEEPS ONE PART OF THE
*    DRAGONSPEAK SCRIPT FROM UNDOING SOMETHING DONE BY THE PREVIOUS
*    TRIGGER.*
*
*    AN ELECTRONIC COMPUTER SENDS ELECTRICITY ALONG THE PATHWAYS, OR "CIRCUITS"
*    OF A MICROCHIP, OR "PROCESSOR".  A CIRCUIT IS LIKE A MAZE FOR THE
*    ELECTRICAL CURRENT TO FOLLOW.  ELECTRICITY GOES IN ONE END AND OUT
*    ANOTHER IN ONLY ONE DIRECTION.  IT PASSES THROUGH "FUNCTION GATES"
*    WHICH CHANGES THE STATE OF THE CURRENT.  THE DRAGONSPEAK BELOW IS
*    THREE TRIGGERS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO TURN A WHITE TILE TO BLACK OR
*    A BLACK TILE TO WHITE.  THIS IS ALOT LIKE THE KIND OF FUNCTION CALLED
*    A "FLIPFLOP".
